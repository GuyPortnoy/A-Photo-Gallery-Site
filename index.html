    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p>My name is Justin Minns and I am a Landscape photographer. Born in England and love to explore the world.
      I am an award-winning professional landscape photographer, best known for atmospheric images of East Anglia. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I am welcoming you to relax, breath slowly and enjoy my photographs.
    </p>

    <h3>Homeland</h3>
    <p>I live in a quiet part of Suffolk in the heart of East Anglia. There where I am takes the most photographs.</p>
    <p>I have visited many countries, like Iceland, Canada, Wales and many more...</p>
    <p>But my heart belongs to the England. There's no place like the beaches of Essex, the castles of Dorset and the fields of Norfolk.</p>

    <h3>Why landscapes photographing?</h3>
    <p>The joy of landscape photograph for me is the being there. Being a part of nature and witnessing its wonders. Those wonderfully unpredictable conditions and fleeting moments of light that make the heart beat a little faster.
    </p> 
    
    <p>The thrill of watching the first light of the day creep over the frozen stillness of a wintry landscape, while the air and my fingers tingle with the cold, and the challenge of capturing the atmosphere of moments like this is what it is all about.</p>
